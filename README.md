Each class has at least 2 methods that use and/or modify class attributes.
The subclass overrides at least one superclass method (this can be init or another method).
Rationale about which methods are private, protected, or public should be provided in code comments or verbally during presentation.
Attributes:

Each class has a least 2 instance attributes created in init()
Rationale about which attributes are private, protected, or public should be provided in code comments or verbally during presentation.
Diagram:

A diagram is provided that shows an overview of all the classes that make up the system design
Diagram shows relationships between classes.
You can achieve this by creating UML Class Diagrams. Here is a template on how to make them, here.
Presentation:

5 - 10 min in-class presentation is given showing off all of the above requirements.
Note: If you cannot make the presentation day, you may turn in a video presentation beforehand to instructor via Slack.
