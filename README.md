Welcome to BlackJack!!

This program is a command line blackjack game where you are playing against the program(dealer).

When ran, the program will deal you and the dealer a card. The dealers cards are hidden until the end of the round.

once a card is dealt, you will see what your card is and your score. The goal is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over.

you will have the option to hit or to stay. If you hit, you will be dealt another card and it will be added to your total score. 
If you stay, the dealer's card will be revealed and if your score is higher, then you win. If it's lower, the dealer wins. 

If you choose to hit and you go over 21, the dealer automatically wins. Aces will be automatically accounted for so if your score is less 
than 10 it will treat it as 11, anything greater than 10 the ace will be treated as 1. If you reach 21, you automatically win.

Hope you enjoy the game and good luck!
